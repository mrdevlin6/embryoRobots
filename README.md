Documentation for my embryo-inspired robotic collective

TODOS:

**Main text (each will have its own plan)**
1. 4-unit intercalation - shape/energy
2. 3-unit critical force - strength/energy
3. 20-unit intercalation - shape/energy
4. 20-unit critical force - strength/energy
5. 4-unit intercalation force at no fluctuations and increasing voltage
6. 3-unit critical force at 110PWM and increasing fluctuations

**Supplemental information**
1. ~~Three different fluctuation signals to decide final signal~~
2. Torque for a single robot
3. Full rendering of robot with part callouts
4. Force characterization of unit-unit attraction
5. Schematic of data collection for intercalation
6. Schematic of data collection for critical force

**Imporant data to dump**
1. Solidwork parts info
2. Bill of materials
3. PCB files
4. Energy/light datalogger code
5. Energy/light documentation
6. ~~Datalogger code -> energy plotting code~~
7. Individual cell code with tunable amplitude fluctuations
